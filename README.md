# cy_to_py

Wouldn't it be nice to have some cython code and then revert it back to python?

To me yes, so that you can write cython code and then still reconvert it in actual python if cython is not installed in the system or something goes wrong at build time, ecc.

I thus hope this to become a library to convert cython code into python code.
